**Project 3 - Employ Matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot**

Complete the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository. To be submitted for credit, all changes must be committed and pushed to this repository (do not create your own repository unless instructed to on the course website). Also saving and exporting the project as an HTML file.

**Objectives**

This exercise is used to reinforce key Python visualization skills. It offers practice with web-enabled Jupyter notebooks and lays some important foundations for presenting information obtained from mining the web and processing language. We'll use the MatplotlibLinks to an external site. library. The Matplotlib library includes the pyplot module which provides a simple interface for building charts. All this code is free - the more you explore, the more you can do. Your skills are limited only by the time you wish to invest.
Anytime we use an external library (something not included in the Python Standard Library) like Matplotlib, we'll need to:

install it into our active virtual environment and use an import statement in our Python.

Spelling and capitalization matters - to use a library, you might need to first search for the install commands and then find the typical way it is imported into Python. The typical approach is to:
Create a virtual environment
Activate the virtual environment
Install into the active virtual environment (e.g. python -m pip install matplotlib)
In your Python, import it (e.g. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)
Rubric
Each question is worth two points:

Data plotted as described by the question (1 pt)
Plot contains required elements (title, axis labels, axis titles, legend if required)
